It requires [fastboot RAM](https://hackspire.org/index.php?title=Memory-mapped_I/O_ports_on_CX#90030000_-_Fastboot_RAM) to persist state across reboots, which is now implemented.\r\n* More accurate emulation of the On button: It's now possible to enter Press-To-Test mode (#271)\r\n* Faster saving and loading of snapshots (#231)\r\n* More reliable USB file transfers\r\n* The debugger console now includes entered commands in the log\r\n* Support for PIE (position-independent executables) on x86_64.

Now they're all released when the keypad loses focus (#287)\r\n* The Ctrl key now changes color when pressed\r\n* Emulation speed no longer remains unlimited after a failed file transfer\r\n\r\n_Repo for Arch, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE: [via OBS](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AVogtinator%3Afirebird-emu&package=firebird-emu&locale=en)._\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress to implement and improve support for running in the browser on Qt for WebAssembly (#294).

      "localizedDescription": "Classic Gaming, Meet iOS.\n\nWhile iPhone and iOS have brought a new era of gaming upon us, there will always be room in our hearts for those classic games from decades ago. Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!",

      "localizedDescription": "Play classic DOS games on your iPhone and iPad!\n\niDOS turns your device right into a powerful DOS gaming PC, with modern game control to make your old favorites as playable as possible.\n\nYou can also use iDOS for non-gaming purposes, such as word processing, casual programming. Apps in the DOS days are often simpler and surprisingly productive.\n\nKEYBOARD\n\niDOS provides a PC compatible on-screen keyboard with carefully designed layouts for different devices and orientations. The keyboard has a sliding control in landscape mode so that you can keep it from covering critical part of the screen.\n\nBluetooth keyboard is partially supported. We support ESC, function keys, and ordinary CTRL and ALT key bindings. Unfortunately the arrow keys can't be used for game control. You should use a bluetooth game controller instead.\n\nGAMEPAD\n\niDOS provides a virtual gamepad with key bindings that are fairly common in DOS games. You can customize the bindings. The DPAD works in 8-axis way. It can also be toggled into a joystick.\n\nExternal bluetooth game controllers are supported. Make sure your game controller is connected (System Settings->Bluetooth). To customize button bindings, go to iDOS in landscape mode, tap on bluetooth icon on the auto-hiding top bar.\n\nMOUSE\n\n* The screen area serves as a trackpad for moving mouse pointer.\n* Tap on the screen for left click. If direct touch is enabled, the mouse pointer will move to where you tap.\n* Hold one finger on the screen, and tap with another finger for right click.\n* On-screen mouse buttons are also provided for your convenience.\n* Bluetooth mice are only partially supported.\n\nSUPPORT\n\n- Visit https://litchie.com/dospad for more information.\n- Send email to idos@litchie.com\n- Follow the developer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/litchiedev\n- iDOS is open source, report issues on https://github.com/litchie/dospad",

Due to the need to mmap the entire ROM into memory, older devices with only 256MB of RAM are not supported.

The software keyboard is a facsimile of the original, reflecting the different existing styles. Even the noise of the disk drive is emulated. The Library section offers a way to organize a large collection of games, demos and programs. The emulated hardware can be customized for each entry.\n\nThe Inbox provides a place to quickly try new programs. You can easily move the ones you want to keep to the library.\n\nTools mode allows attaching a cartridge like Action Replay or Final Cartridge and a collection of disks with your favorite tools, to help you dig into the programs, like back in the day.",

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v8.0.2**\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms. This means that v4.3.1 may contain a lot of UI bugs as testing is needed to make sure the new internals match up with the existing UI. Please help us by reporting any such issue you stumble upon.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it. (#4667)\r\n* (macOS) Ignore missing links (drives, shared directory, etc) when saving an Apple VM\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to force Num Lock on (#4625)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to prevent idle sleep while VM is running (#4963)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to suppress exit confirmation (#4989)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed delete drive confirmation not showing up on latest macOS\r\n* (macOS) Fixed disposable mode stuck on when a VM is run once in disposable mode (#5025)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where a moved or deleted VM with a stopped window open will attempt to use the old path (#4985)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed cursor scrolling and double click issues (#4636, #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Support following a change in system default input or output audio device (#3488)\r\n* (macOS) Support retry of macOS installation when it fails (the IPSW will not automatically be unlinked)\r\n* (macOS) Support retaining of installer IPSW bookmark across VM moves and UTM restarts (#4938)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n* There is a known bug in newer versions of Mesa which prevents some Wayland applications (such as Firefox) from launching when GPU acceleration is enabled. One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it. (#4667)\r\n* (macOS) Ignore missing links (drives, shared directory, etc) when saving an Apple VM\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to force Num Lock on (#4625)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to prevent idle sleep while VM is running (#4963)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to suppress exit confirmation (#4989)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed delete drive confirmation not showing up on latest macOS\r\n* (macOS) Fixed disposable mode stuck on when a VM is run once in disposable mode (#5025)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where a moved or deleted VM with a stopped window open will attempt to use the old path (#4985)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed cursor scrolling and double click issues (#4636, #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Support following a change in system default input or output audio device (#3488)\r\n* (macOS) Support retry of macOS installation when it fails (the IPSW will not automatically be unlinked)\r\n* (macOS) Support retaining of installer IPSW bookmark across VM moves and UTM restarts (#4938)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n* There is a known bug in newer versions of Mesa which prevents some Wayland applications (such as Firefox) from launching when GPU acceleration is enabled. One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled. Please use the text installer instead.\r\n* The Metal renderer backend is broken on macOS, please change your renderer to OpenGL or \"Default\"\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

          "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars. Added a new SwiftUI crash workaround thanks to @evelyneee.\r\n* Display all sizes in binary (MiB/GiB) mode in order to be consistent (#4396)\r\n* Localization: added Polish (thanks @mavethee)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the port forward UI on macOS 11 and introduce a new port forward UI for macOS 12+ (#4690)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed \"This virtual machine cannot be run on this machine.\" error on a newly created Apple VM (#4595)\r\n* (macOS) Added new 21:9 widescreen resolution for Apple VMs (thanks @Tandolf)\r\n* (macOS) Added a clarifying message about shared directory support on older macOS guests (#4594)\r\n* (macOS) Added new shutdown options (software request and force kill) which can be toggled by long pressing the power button in the VM window (#4001)\r\n* (macOS) Added a confirmation dialog when deleting a drive (#4687)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.0)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.1.0\r\n* Updated ANGLE and virglrenderer to latest commit\r\n* Fixed an issue where user override of machine property settings was not applied properly\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (iOS) Added in-app settings popover which synchronizes with the Settings app (useful for TrollStore installs where the Settings app page is inaccessible) (#4446)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: support JIT without needing a separate JIT enabler (thanks @PojavLauncherTeam for the idea)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spainish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped.

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale\r\n* (macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.1)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2\r\n* Refactored QEMU support to a new project: [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit)\r\n* Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.0)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0\r\n* Changed audio backend from CoreAudio back to SPICE (as it was before v4.2.x). Clarify that CoreAudio backend does not support microphone (#5253)\r\n* Add support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (#5295)\r\n* Wizard: Properly display an error message when there is a failure writing to disk (#5271)\r\n* Fixed an issue where ISAPC emulation target cannot be started (#5280)\r\n* Fixed CoreAudio being instantiated even when audio is disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where legacy VMs with AC97 sound card has an empty name in settings\r\n* Fixed an QEMU issue where the `ucomiss` instruction causes a crash in some applications (#5294)\r\n* Fixed an issue preventing VMs with commas in their name from starting (note only new VMs will be fixed) (#5332)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Support canceling macOS installation\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Added `delete` command (#5290)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue creating a shortcut from drag & drop as well as double clicking from Finder (#5310, #5311)\r\n* (macOS) Added DHCP start/end settings for vmnet (#5301)\r\n* (macOS) Added automatically syncing of system clock when macOS wakes up from sleep (when QEMU guest agent is installed) (#5252)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option.

          "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spainish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped.
