Apps in the DOS days are often simpler and surprisingly productive.\n\nKEYBOARD\n\niDOS provides a PC compatible on-screen keyboard with carefully designed layouts for different devices and orientations. The keyboard has a sliding control in landscape mode so that you can keep it from covering critical part of the screen.\n\nBluetooth keyboard is partially supported. We support ESC, function keys, and ordinary CTRL and ALT key bindings. Unfortunately the arrow keys can't be used for game control. You should use a bluetooth game controller instead.\n\nGAMEPAD\n\niDOS provides a virtual gamepad with key bindings that are fairly common in DOS games. You can customize the bindings. The DPAD works in 8-axis way. It can also be toggled into a joystick.\n\nExternal bluetooth game controllers are supported. Make sure your game controller is connected (System Settings->Bluetooth). To customize button bindings, go to iDOS in landscape mode, tap on bluetooth icon on the auto-hiding top bar.\n\nMOUSE\n\n* The screen area serves as a trackpad for moving mouse pointer.\n* Tap on the screen for left click. If direct touch is enabled, the mouse pointer will move to where you tap.\n* Hold one finger on the screen, and tap with another finger for right click.\n* On-screen mouse buttons are also provided for your convenience.\n* Bluetooth mice are only partially supported.\n\nSUPPORT\n\n- Visit https://litchie.com/dospad for more information.\n- Send email to idos@litchie.com\n- Follow the developer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/litchiedev\n- iDOS is open source, report issues on https://github.com/litchie/dospad",

Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia \u2014 it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced \u2014 enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.\n\nSpecial Features:\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Built almost entirely using SwiftUI.\n* \ud83c\udfa8 Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.\n* \ud83d\udcf1 Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.\n* \u2764\ufe0f A testament to the work of Apple employees of both the past and the present.\n* \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on.",

The software keyboard is a facsimile of the original, reflecting the different existing styles. Even the noise of the disk drive is emulated. The Library section offers a way to organize a large collection of games, demos and programs. The emulated hardware can be customized for each entry.\n\nThe Inbox provides a place to quickly try new programs. You can easily move the ones you want to keep to the library.\n\nTools mode allows attaching a cartridge like Action Replay or Final Cartridge and a collection of disks with your favorite tools, to help you dig into the programs, like back in the day.",

The updated wizard can create more working configurations such as RISC-V64 Ubuntu, classic Mac OS 8.x/9.x, and Windows 95/98.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.4)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash on VM start when a toolbar menu was reinitialized (note v4.7.4 was re-released to address this) (#7408)\r\n* Home: Fixed layout issue with button titles\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when VM exits while USB is active\r\n* (iOS) Support for StikDebug on iOS 26 (non-SE only)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM results in a block device error\r\n* Stop button can now be used a second time to force kill a VM if it is unresponsive after stopping for the first time\r\n* libusb: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes when using USB capture\r\n* CocoaSpice: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes during VM start\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed broken commands due to name collision (#7360)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when exiting full screen (#7377)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.2)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed a crash when starting any Apple Virtualization VM (#7355) (We are re-releasing v4.7.2 with build 112 due to this critical bug.)\r\n* Home: Display network details and active IP addresses on the home details screen (thanks @gabefair)\r\n* Home: Show a security warning message when importing a .utm with custom arguments (#6252)\r\n* Config: Option to reset UEFI without pre-loading Secure Boot keys (useful for custom TPM configurations) (#7005)\r\n* Config: Pre-loading Secure Boot keys will now install Microsoft UEFI 2023 certificates (#7257)\r\n* Config: When PS/2 device is enabled, no longer create USB mouse and keyboard devices. This allows older Windows install to work out of the box.\r\n* Config: Quotes in custom arguments are no longer stripped (unless the only quotes wrap the entire argument) (#6343)\r\n* Config: Provide a fixed serial number for VirtIO block devices (#7332)\r\n* QEMU: Fixed an issue which causes Windows 98 to BSoD (#7342)\r\n* QEMU: Do not create a default floppy drive when -nodefaults is used. UTM configuration will set up a FDC device and this is the only way to set up bootindex for floppy.\r\n* Wizard: Legacy Windows configurations will now use PS/2 controller by default\r\n* Wizard: Update OS logos to be consistent with other icons\r\n* Wizard: Windows + i440fx hardware will now instantiate default devices (sound, VGA, networking) that should work with Windows 95/98\r\n* Wizard: Add additional supported hardware configurations for running older Windows\r\n* Wizard: Support floppy boot for Windows configuration\r\n* Scripting: New input automation suite for sending keyboard and mouse input (#6462)\r\n* USB: Fixed a rare crash when initializing the USB devices list (#5811)\r\n* SPICE: Fixed an issue where monitor configuration sent to spice-vdagent contains an invalid size (#5832)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Fix foreground issue on iOS 26 beta 5 and higher\r\n* (macOS) Added ability to auto-connect USB devices on start (#3400)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed connecting USB devices from secondary windows\r\n* (macOS) New \"Virtual Machine\" menu which mirrors the actions accessible through the toolbar\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard Shortcuts toolbar icon is no longer shown by default (it can be placed on the toolbar through View -> Customize Toolbar).

This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU v10.0.2**: The backend has been updated to the latest upstream QEMU which brings with it a variety of bug fixes and performance improvements.\r\n* **Liquid Glass**: UTM adopts the Liquid Glass design on *OS 26.\r\n* **App Intents**: New support for automation with Shortcuts.\r\n* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Define custom key combinations (such as Ctrl+Alt+Del) that can be sent to the VM from the new Keyboard menu.\r\n* **Improved Wizard**: Simplify the creation of emulated machines by selecting from a list of well-supported configurations. The updated wizard can create more working configurations such as RISC-V64 Ubuntu, classic Mac OS 8.x/9.x, and Windows 95/98.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.4)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash on VM start when a toolbar menu was reinitialized (note v4.7.4 was re-released to address this) (#7408)\r\n* Home: Fixed layout issue with button titles\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when VM exits while USB is active\r\n* (iOS) Support for StikDebug on iOS 26 (non-SE only)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM results in a block device error\r\n* Stop button can now be used a second time to force kill a VM if it is unresponsive after stopping for the first time\r\n* libusb: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes when using USB capture\r\n* CocoaSpice: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes during VM start\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed broken commands due to name collision (#7360)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when exiting full screen (#7377)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.2)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed a crash when starting any Apple Virtualization VM (#7355) (We are re-releasing v4.7.2 with build 112 due to this critical bug.)\r\n* Home: Display network details and active IP addresses on the home details screen (thanks @gabefair)\r\n* Home: Show a security warning message when importing a .utm with custom arguments (#6252)\r\n* Config: Option to reset UEFI without pre-loading Secure Boot keys (useful for custom TPM configurations) (#7005)\r\n* Config: Pre-loading Secure Boot keys will now install Microsoft UEFI 2023 certificates (#7257)\r\n* Config: When PS/2 device is enabled, no longer create USB mouse and keyboard devices. This allows older Windows install to work out of the box.\r\n* Config: Quotes in custom arguments are no longer stripped (unless the only quotes wrap the entire argument) (#6343)\r\n* Config: Provide a fixed serial number for VirtIO block devices (#7332)\r\n* QEMU: Fixed an issue which causes Windows 98 to BSoD (#7342)\r\n* QEMU: Do not create a default floppy drive when -nodefaults is used. UTM configuration will set up a FDC device and this is the only way to set up bootindex for floppy.\r\n* Wizard: Legacy Windows configurations will now use PS/2 controller by default\r\n* Wizard: Update OS logos to be consistent with other icons\r\n* Wizard: Windows + i440fx hardware will now instantiate default devices (sound, VGA, networking) that should work with Windows 95/98\r\n* Wizard: Add additional supported hardware configurations for running older Windows\r\n* Wizard: Support floppy boot for Windows configuration\r\n* Scripting: New input automation suite for sending keyboard and mouse input (#6462)\r\n* USB: Fixed a rare crash when initializing the USB devices list (#5811)\r\n* SPICE: Fixed an issue where monitor configuration sent to spice-vdagent contains an invalid size (#5832)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Fix foreground issue on iOS 26 beta 5 and higher\r\n* (macOS) Added ability to auto-connect USB devices on start (#3400)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed connecting USB devices from secondary windows\r\n* (macOS) New \"Virtual Machine\" menu which mirrors the actions accessible through the toolbar\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard Shortcuts toolbar icon is no longer shown by default (it can be placed on the toolbar through View -> Customize Toolbar). It is also accessible through the \"Virtual Machine\" menu.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed sending simultaneous mouse button presses (#7068)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Add `version` command to detect current UTM version\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to disable key swapping on ISO keyboards (#6976)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to randomize network MAC addresses on clone (#7035)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.1)\r\n* New Liquid Glass icon thanks to @forcequitOS\r\n* Added App Intents for VM operations (#6245)\r\n* Added UEFI boot support for RISC-V64 and LoongArch64. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.
